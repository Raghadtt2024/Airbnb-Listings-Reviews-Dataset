# Airbnb Listings Reviews Dataset

Airbnb is a global accommodation service that can be rented out in major cities. It is run by Airbnb Inc. The current data includes listings, such as host details, property specifics, cost, availability, and visitor evaluations. It includes information on more than 250,000 listings in ten major cities as well as more than 5 million past reviews. The project will help researchers, analysts, and stakeholders to examine trends, attitudes, and patterns pertaining to visitor experiences. Making data-driven decisions about pricing, marketing, and customer support is possible with this information, which can also be utilized to increase customer satisfaction and the quality of listings.
